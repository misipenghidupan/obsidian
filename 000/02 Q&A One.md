okey i will go further into blueprint of system design. i think pre-production phase is all about collecting-cleansing-structuring-maintaining data right? in this context i have a idea to start with obsidian consider it's flexibility and rich abundant plugin. assess this my very significant first step.
### **Assessment of Obsidian as a First Step**

Your idea to start with Obsidian is an excellent and highly significant first step. It aligns perfectly with your "little significant step by step" philosophy as a solo software architect. Using Obsidian for the pre-production data phase is a pragmatic choice that leverages its core strengths while mitigating the risks of starting a complex project from scratch.

### **Strengths of Using Obsidian**

1. **Flexibility and Local Control**: Obsidian is built on plain Markdown files, giving you **complete ownership and control** over your data. This is crucial. Unlike a proprietary database or cloud service, your data is not locked in, making it easy to migrate to a custom backend later. The decentralized nature of a local vault is a significant advantage for this initial data-gathering phase.
    
2. **Rich Plugin Ecosystem for Structuring and Visualization**: This is Obsidian's greatest asset for your project. You mentioned its abundant plugins, and they are perfect for your pre-production needs.
    
    - **Dataview**: This plugin transforms your notes into a queryable database. You can write simple queries to extract and organize data based on metadata in your notes (e.g., dates, locations, categories). This is your initial "database" for the project.
        
    - **Templater**: You can use this to create structured templates for each historical entry. For example, a "Historical Event" template could have pre-defined fields for `date`, `location`, `participants`, and `sources`. This enforces consistency from the beginning.
        
    - **Community Graph and 3D Graph Plugins**: Obsidian's built-in graph view is a great starting point for visualizing connections between notes. There are community plugins that can extend this into interactive 3D graphs, providing a preliminary look at your future visualization goals.
        
    - **Timeline and Calendar Plugins**: Plugins like **"Obsidian Timeline"** or similar tools can generate visual timelines directly from your notes, providing an early proof-of-concept for the chronological visualization aspect.
        
    - **API-based Plugins**: Some plugins, like the **"Obsidian Local REST API"** plugin, can expose your vault data via an API. This means you could, with some effort, build a simple web interface or a script to query your data without even needing a full backend yet.
        
3. **Low Barrier to Entry and Collaboration**: Since you have a small, growing team, Obsidian's collaborative features (via shared vaults and version control with Git) are an excellent way to get the team contributing content immediately without needing to set up a complex database and user management system. It's a frictionless way to start building the "community" aspect.

### **Risks and Future Considerations**

While Obsidian is a great starting point, it's not the ultimate solution for your goal of a "globally growing app."

1. **Scalability**: Obsidian is a file-based system designed for individual or small-team use. It is **not a true database**. It will not handle the millions of data points and concurrent users your final app will need. You will eventually need to migrate the data to a scalable, production-grade database like PostgreSQL or a graph database like Neo4j.
    
2. **Web and Mobile App Backend**: Obsidian itself is not a backend. You cannot serve your app's content directly from an Obsidian vault. You will have to build a dedicated backend server with a robust API to access, process, and serve your structured data to the front-end clients (web and mobile apps). The initial data collected in Obsidian will be a springboard for this next phase.
    
3. **Real-time Collaboration**: While Git can be used for version control in an Obsidian vault, it's not a real-time collaboration solution like Google Docs or Figma. It's a valuable crutch for the early stages, but a true wiki will require a more sophisticated, multi-user editing system.
    

### **Expert Opinion**

Your plan to start with Obsidian for the pre-production phase is not just a good idea—it's **strategically sound**. It prioritizes **data-centric development** over premature and complex infrastructure building. By using Obsidian, you can:

- **Rapidly prototype** your data models and visualization concepts.
    
- **Empower your team** to begin content creation immediately.
    
- **De-risk the project** by proving the viability of the data structure and content before investing heavily in a full-scale backend.
    

This first step is a classic agile approach: build a minimum viable data product first, then use that to inform the development of your full-scale application. The data collected and organized in Obsidian will be the invaluable seed for your future, globally-scaled system.
